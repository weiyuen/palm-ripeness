This repository contains code for our paper [Coloured Edge Maps for Oil Palm Ripeness Classification](https://www.bmvc2021-virtualconference.com/assets/papers/0946.pdf).
More specifically, the `conversion_functions.py` file contains all the preprocessing functions used to extract the coloured edge maps referenced in the paper.
